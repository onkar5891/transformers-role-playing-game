Transformers Role Playing Game ©

Story Line:
A great battle took place between the Autobots and the Decepticons
over the possession of the Cube on Cybertron, the home planet of
Transformers. Megatron, the leader of Decepticons, was able to
escape with the Cube on Earth, the home planet of Humans. With him
was dangerous Slipstream, a female Decepticon, who helped him do so.
Fortunately, there exists a true Warrior Autobot (you) on Earth
whom Optimus Prime has already communicated about this situation.

Your MISSION: Kill them both and take the Cube.
(Beware of their weapons!)

You can move on the Battlefield to reach them, and can Attack,
Defend, Stay Still or Retreat. Make sure that Staying Still on the
battlefield or Retreating has an added advantage to the enemy. Only
your health will be affected in this case. During the battle, you
can save the state by selecting '0' (hidden option), and load it
back from the main menu.

Go Ahead, Warrior!
