[36mStory Line:[0m
A great battle took place between the Autobots and the Decepticons
over the possession of the Cube on Cybertron, the home planet of
Transformers. Megatron, the leader of Decepticons, was able to
escape with the Cube on Earth, the home planet of Humans. With him
was dangerous Slipstream, a female Decepticon, who helped him do so.
Fortunately, there exists a true Warrior Autobot (you) on Earth
whom Optimus Prime has already communicated about this situation.
